## End to End Machine Learning Project
# Student Performance Prediction System

The **Student Performance Prediction System** is an intelligent machine learning application designed to predict student math scores based on academic and demographic factors. It can perform various actions such as:
- Processing and transforming educational data
- Training multiple machine learning models automatically  
- Selecting the best performing algorithm
- Providing predictions through a web interface
- Handling both numerical and categorical data
- Generating comprehensive logs and error reports
